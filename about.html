			<h2>Chess</h2>
				<p class = "desc">
					Over the course of quarantine, I have taken a strong interest in the game of chess, which has provided me with mental stimulation and the opportunity to improve my descision making and problem solving skills. One of my favorite chess openings is known as the Stafford Gambit, analysed here to highlight its exciting nature.
					<br><br>
					To play me, send me a challenge on <a href = https://www.chess.com/member/camlongf>chess.com!</a>

				<h2>Animals</h2>
				<p class = "desc">
					Animals play a large role in my life. They have taught me compassion, responsibility, and humility. I have chosen to show you here my sleepy old dog Ziggy, my adventurous little hamster Hugo, a cuddly stray cat I befriended, and a gorgeous baby snake I had the pleasure to meet at a reptile expo. </p>
